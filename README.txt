3- ABOUT THE GAME

Plume Brothers was developed to obtain notes on the "Computer Programming"
discipline (at first momment). So, the idea of the game was create something
baseed in those lovely games, based in an constant increasing of the difficulty 
on game.

At the first time, the idea was do a mix with our "Plume heros", using "Pokémon" and
"Angry Birds" monsters. But it's just a prototype, just to knows how the GoSu Lib with 
the Ruby language. In a future not so far, I wanna' draw my own chars and change those 
"loaned monsters", but they're just an representation, have no special reason to choose
"pokémons" and "Angry Birds" monsters, haha.

Programming games using GoSu library is very intersting, we can find a lot of usefull methods
directed to objects orientation on the game.

I hope you like this game, and, if possible, helps me to make this game better!! =)
